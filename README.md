## About

Linear Search (also known as Sequential Search) is the simplest search algorithm that checks every element in a list until the target value is found or the list ends. It is easy to implement but has a time complexity of O(n).

This repository provides:
- **Step-by-step explanations** of how the algorithm works
- **Test cases** to verify correctness

---

## Features

- Customizable test suites with different data sizes
- Clear inline comments and documentation
- Examples with edge cases (empty lists, non-existing elements)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sobhan661/Linear-Search.git
cd Linear-Search
```
