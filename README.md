## About

Linear Search (also known as Sequential Search) is the simplest search algorithm that checks every element in a list until the target value is found or the list ends. It is easy to implement but has a time complexity of O(n).

This repository provides:
- **Readable implementations** in various languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++)
- **Step-by-step explanations** of how the algorithm works
- **Test cases** to verify correctness

---

## Features

- Multiple language support: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more
- Customizable test suites with different data sizes
- Clear inline comments and documentation
- Examples with edge cases (empty lists, non-existing elements)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-search-algorithm.git
cd linear-search-algorithm
```
2. **Install dependencies** (if any)

_For Python example_:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_For JavaScript example_:  
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Choose your preferred language folder and run the example file. Examples:

- **Python**
```bash
python examples/python/linear_search.py
```

- **JavaScript**
```bash
node examples/js/linearSearch.js
```

- **C++**
```bash
g++ examples/cpp/linear_search.cpp -o linear_search && ./linear_search
```

## Examples

### Python Example
```python
from linear_search import linear_search

arr = [3, 5, 2, 4, 9]
target = 4
index = linear_search(arr, target)
print(f"Element found at index: {index}" if index != -1 else "Not found")
```

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
const { linearSearch } = require('../src/linearSearch');

const arr = [3, 5, 2, 4, 9];
const target = 4;
const index = linearSearch(arr, target);
console.log(index !== -1 ? \`Element found at index: \${index}\` : 'Not found');
```
